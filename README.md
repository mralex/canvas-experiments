Game design related experiments for HTML5 Canvas
================================================

### Tested with:
 * Firefox 11 beta
 * Chrome

These experiments are built using jQuery 1.7.1 and John Resig's simple JS inheritance library. 

Most of this code isn't particularly clean, tidy, optimized, or in any way release worthy.

Experiments
-----------

1. Simple drawing on screen via a mainloop
2. Vector math test. On-screen bugs are attracted to the mouse cursor, and repulsed on a mouse click.
3. Tilemap test. Move the map around with W, S, A, D.
4. Tilemap test with NPC mobs. Same as 3, with a set of mobs that race across the map.
5. Spritemap test. A tilemap rendered with sprites loaded from a spritemap (sprite atlas).
