    <h1>Game design related experiments for HTML5 Canvas</h1>

<h3>Tested with:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Firefox 11 beta</li>
    <li> Chrome</li>
</ul>
<p>
These experiments are built using jQuery 1.7.1 and John Resig's simple JS inheritance library. 
</p>
<p>
Most of this code isn't particularly clean, tidy, optimized, or in any way release worthy.
</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>

<ol>
    <li><a href="1/">Simple drawing on screen via a mainloop</a></li>
    <li><a href="2/">Vector math test. On-screen bugs are attracted to the mouse cursor, and repulsed on a mouse click.</a></li>
    <li><a href="3/">Tilemap test. Move the map around with W, S, A, D.</a></li>
    <li><a href="4/">Tilemap test with NPC mobs. Same as 3, with a set of mobs that race across the map.</a></li>
    <li><a href="5/">Spritemap test. A tilemap rendered with sprites loaded from a spritemap (sprite atlas).</a></li>
    <li><a href="6/">Player character movement test. Introduced a player character object who can move around on the map.</a></li>
</ol>
